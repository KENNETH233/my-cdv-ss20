          <p>How to define sneaker culture? Before 21th century, sneakers were a very niche sports subculture.The earliest fans of sneaker culture were heavily influenced by sports. For example, <strong style="color:#ce1126">Michael Jordan's signed sneakers "Air Jordan"</strong> were pursued by many sneakerhead (It also happens now ) 👉</p>
          <p>According to ESPN NBA feature writer Nick DePaula, who's also the creative director at Nice Kicks, a sneaker-focused media outlet,
          </p>
          <p class="quotation"> “When I was growing up in the '90s, it was really fueled by your favorite players and the performance of the shoe,"  "And now it's totally shifted and become about the visibility and the status — more of the how to wear them.”

          <p>Today's sneaker culture is not just limited to sports. It has become more fashionable, which means that the audience of sneaker culture has become larger, not just sports fans, the sneaker market has also become larger. This also lets the sports brand see the huge profit space.<strong> Sneaker brands can raise prices and create frenzied demand by the collaboration with celebrity and crazy marketing strategy</strong></p>

          <p>Sports brands like Nike and Adidas are trying to promote collaboration with fashion designers, stars, and celebrities on sneaker design. The most typical cases, which are the subject I am going to visualize, are Nike Off-White collaboration and Adidas Yeezy</p>
          <p>👉</p>

          <p>Because sneaker brands release a very limited number of sneakers, not everyone who likes them can buy them. This situation creates the possibility of a transaction. If you buy shoes from Nike or Adi at retail prices and sell them at a higher price, can you make a huge profit? The answer is yes!!! This is the start of the formation of sneaker secondary market.
          </p>

          <p>But something crazy happens after the release of these sneakers... </p>

        <h3 id="Changes">Crazy secondary market</h3>

        <p>
        Imagine that, Nike and Adidas are commercial companies, and they release their stocks to the market <strong>(high-priced, limited number, co-designed sneakers)</strong>, and those stocks are still floating around in the market <strong>(sneakers are not on people's feet, they've traded in the secondary market)</strong>. That's what's going on in the secondary market, the sneaker is not just something we wear, it's a form of capital, like a stock.

        <p >These 500 circles are the <strong style="color:#c9bdb7">Adidas Yeezy</strong> and <strong style="color:#cf4e04">Nike Off-White</strong>'s purchases records on StockX, a sneaker resale platform. Firstly, Nike and Adidas release them into market. X axis represents time and Y axis represents the retail price of each shoes</p>

        <p id="Resale"> After the first release, some of these sneakers were traded immediately, and some of them were in the market for a long time (see the line👉). Also, the difference in price between retail price and resale price is quite large. The largest difference can reach thousands of dollars.

        <p id="Profit">This is the visualization of profits. Each point represents a purchase. The axis shows the range of profits. You can see that most of the purchases can create 0-200 dollar's profit. Look closely at the circles located at the left part of the axis, outside the axis. <strong style="font-size:24px">These are the cases of bad trade!</strong> Just like stocks, the prices will go higher while the prices will fall as well.</p>

# Reading reflection of Week1

=============================


## Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)


I think the reason why Bowker says this is that data, as we learned from the first class, is never raw but cooked. Data is the trace left by the human in various behavior in different aspects. As I understood, data itself has no value without the interpretation of the human analysis. Drilled down to the fact of data, it is impossible to assign a good/bad conclusion to data. We "cook" data and generate value from the cooking process. Therefore, Bowker is against the idea of "raw data", he does not like this idea. He also thinks that it is a "bad idea" to say "data is raw" because this logic will bias the truth about how we create value with data.


## What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"?


Accounting tools are the tools people use for collecting and analyzing data. Becuase data is never raw but cooked, the cooking process will ultimately reach to a conclusion. The conclusion, actually, is a kind of artificial interpretation, it is subjectively and cannot reflect the fact to some extent. Therefore, they actually cook data in the way they want to show the data. What the public see is the "reality" shaped and conveyed by the "cook" of data.


## In which way is Twitter data limited?


In my opinion, the statement of "limit" the data is not objective or data quality cannot be guranteed. There are two elements resulting in this issue--the users and the companies like Twitter themselves. Firstly, the data left by users sometimes cannout objectively show anyingthing. For example, some users have multiple accounts; one account can be run by several users at one time; some users are bots; also some users'data are hiden because they do not want to show their digtal traces publicly. So the data is limited in the users level. On the other hand, Twitter, or other similar social media platforms, their data will be limited in the way that they choose to ignore, hide, or even place their interpretative conclusion on the data they gain. For example, during the virus outbreak period, Chinese version Twitter, Weibo, they add control to the immediate data about the epidemic situation so that they can maintain the stability of society.


## If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.


Definitely, it isn't. "Being in public" is different from "Being public". "Being in public", as I understand, means that your digital data(your using behavior, your digital information, your digital network, etc.) is all exposed in a public space on the Internet. Those data are open to the public but you still own your data, which means anyone who has no permission cannot get access to your data. However, "Being public" means that everyone has access to your data, you also own the right to remove or change it, but you have no right to stop others using your data. Currently, data has to be "being public" because the owner or the holder ignores the issues of personal data privacy and at the same time the manipulator of data jump over the process of gaining accessibility. It does not mean that the data is public and free to use("Being public"). I think the defaulted status of data should be "Being in public". That is my opinion.

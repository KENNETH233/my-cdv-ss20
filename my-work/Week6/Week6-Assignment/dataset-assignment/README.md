# Week6 Assignment

## Take a deep dive into the datasets that you can find online.

### StockX shoes datasets

[OFF-White&Yeezy sales dataset 2017-2019](https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/)

This dataset consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 (the month that Off-White first debuted “The Ten” collection) and 2019 Febuary. There are 99,956 total sales in the data set; 27,794 Off-White sales, and 72,162 Yeezy sales. The sample consists of U.S. sales only. I want to use this dataset to visualize the competition between Nike and Adidas. I may build some visulazation to show how the prices change of each shoes, sales comparison, ordering region and the most popular colorway of shoes.

### Billboard charts

[The weekly updated HOT100 section in Billboards charts from 2015 to 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/saberianz/billboard-charts/data)

This dataset shows the Billboard weekly hot100 from 2015 to 2019. In this dataset, we can see many features of data like "Song name", Artists, Weeks on no.1 and etc. So it is interesting if I can visualize the hotest song throughout 4 years, make a competition among all the NO.1 songs between 2015 to 2019. Also I can visualize how long those hot songs remain on the charts.

### Google Play Store Apps

[Web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analysing the Android market](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)

This datasets consists of 10k Play Store apps information in the Android market. We can get to know many aspects of apps on Play Store: Apps names, category, installs, rating, reviews, paid or free and etc. So it is very interesting to visualize those apps info in the way like comparing installs, dividing apps into paid group and free group, categorize apps and visualize the category.
